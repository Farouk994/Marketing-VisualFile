**<Accessibility>**

1 - Viewport was added to index file <head> tag to enable a more responsive and an accessible website for all mobile devices, laptops and ipads/Tabs. 

# Updating Semantics 
1 - ID attribute was updated in the <nav> as it was missing and "id" attribute, this will enable the page to connect to all other pages with ease targeting the specific id attribute like images or links

2 - <nav> has been added on page at the top to help create interfaces that work for everyone in the most performant, robust, and simple way possible. They add essential meaning to your content, which lets web browsers, search engines, screen readers, RSS readers, and ultimately users understand it.

# Updating Styling

1 - I generally wanted to keep my code clean to reduce the risk of bugs. This is mostly common with CSS styling as classes keep piling up which are not that necessary in achieving a final result, the best way i can keep it simple and direct is by erasing some classes and combine together under one particular tag which is a parent in our <index.html>. These tags will enable us in the future have the ability to correct and change if there need be and to stay more organized.

2 - <h2> <img> <h3> have all been updated, this was done by reducing on number of classes nested in some of these tags in our style.css file and mainly targetting them with specific tags that act as a parent in the index.html file.
