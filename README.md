Accessibility**

1 - Viewport was added to index file <head> tag to enable a more responsive and an accessible website for all mobile devices, laptops and ipads/Tabs. 

Updating Semantics** 
1 - ID attribute was updated in the <nav> as it was missing and "id" attribute, this will enable the page to connect to all other pages with ease targeting the specific id attribute like images or links

2 - 

Updating Styling**

1 - I generally wanted to keep my code clean to reduce the risk of bugs. This is mostly common with CSS styling as classes keep piling up which are not that necessary in achieving a final result, the best way i can keep it simple and direct is by erasing some classes and combine together under one particular tag which is a parent in our <index.html>. These tags will enable us in the future have the ability to correct and change if there need be and to stay more organized.
